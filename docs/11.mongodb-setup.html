# Overview

--

## Concept

MongoDB is a popular "document-oriented" database.

--

- MongoDB records are stored as Javascript Object Notation (JSON) documents.

--

- commands and queries issued to the command-line MongoDB **client** program are written in Javascript.

--

- MongoDB integrates easily with popular programming languages, such as Javascript, Python, and others.

---

template: overview

## Document-oriented database

MongoDB is not a relational database. It does not use the SQL query language. It attempts to fill a need for document-centric databases that can scale up or down rapidly, as needed.

--

- no more tables, rows, or columns

--

- data are stored as "documents" in "collections"

--

- a database server can house many "collections"

--

- documents can contain the equivalent of primary and foreign keys

---

template: overview

## No SQL

MongoDB is part of the "NoSQL" movement of databases that do not use SQL.

--

- MongoDB uses its own query language, based on Javascript

--

- many app or web programmers know Javascript, so this should make it more approachable

--

- [read more about the NoSQL trend](http://www.w3resource.com/mongodb/nosql.php) in database systems

---

template: overview

## Flexible data model

Schema-less, meaning there is no fixed set of fields in any document

--

- Documents can have whatever fields you decide to store in them

--

- Even documents within the same collection can differ in their fields

---

template: overview

## Cross-platform

MongoDB can run be "installed" and "setup" on all popular platforms, including Mac, Windows, Linux, and UNIX

--

- "Drivers" are available to be "installed" for most popular programming languages to allow them to communicate with MongoDB databases

---

template: overview

## Highly scalable

Built-in ability to be "sharded"

--

- a single database can be split across many servers, or even many thousands of servers

--

- this allows MongoDB to potentially run thousands of times faster than if a database were on a single computer with limited processing and memory power

---

template: overview

## Fast for large data sets

MongoDB is fast for large data sets

--

- includes sophisticated **indexes** to "pre-sort" results before queried

--

- supports many aggregate functions

---

template: overview

## Geospatial search

MongoDB has built-in ability to store geospatial coordinates

--

- this means it can perform searches for documents "near me"

--

- easily performs searches within a particular radius of any location

--

- in other words, it can order results by how far they are from any geospatial location

## Industry-proven

MongoDB is used by:

--

- GitHub

--

- Etsy

--

- Google

--

- Ebay

--

- Expedia

--

- and [many more](https://www.mongodb.com/who-uses-mongodb)

# Setup

--

## Using a server

There are several easy ways to try out a MongoDB **server**.

--

- [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) can be downloaded and tried locally on your own machine for free.

--

- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is a cloud-hosted database service with a free tier for new users and small-scale applications.

--

- NYU's Computer Science Department hosts its own MongoDB server at [class-mongodb.cims.nyu.edu:27017](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/userservices/databases/class-mongodb), which all students can access.

--
**We will use this.**

---

template: setup

## Create an account on NYU CS Department's MongoDB server

All students will need to initialize an account on our MongoDB server using the ["Class MongoDB Manager"](https://cims.nyu.edu/class-mongodb/manage)

--

- enter your `i6.cims.nyu.edu` web server username and password. You should have received an email with that password soon after registering for the course.

--

- if your **i6** password does not work, or you can't find it, [reset it](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/password/reset) and try a new one.

---

template: setup

## Server credentials

Once logged in, the Class MongoDB Manager will show you your password for the MongoDB database server - this is different from your **i6** web server password.

--

You will need to save the following credentials somewhere.

- `database server/host` - this is `class-mongodb.cims.nyu.edu`, port `27017`
- `your database name` - this is the same as your NYU Net ID
- `username` - this is the same as your NYU Net ID
- `password` - this will be displayed to you by the Manager tool

---

template: setup

## Using a client

Once set up with a server, you must access it using a **client**. There are several common ways to use a MongoDB client:

--

- Download and install [MongoDB's official shell](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell) client, which you can run from the command line of your own machine.

--

- Use `ssh` to remotely log into NYU CS department's `i6.cims.nyu.edu` server, where a `mongo` shell is already installed.

--

- Mac users have `ssh` already installed. Windows users can use [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), which includes `ssh` within Git Bash.

--

- The command, `ssh fb1258@i6.cims.nyu.edu` will remotely log in to the **i6** server.

--

- You will be asked to enter your **i6** server password. It will not show up on the screen as you type it - that is absolutely normal and desireable and not a cause for concern.

---

template: setup
name: connect-to-mongo

## Connecting to MongoDB from NYU CS Department's i6 Web Server

Once logged into the **i6** web server, you can use the `mongo` command line client to connect to the MongoDB database server.

--

- Run the command, `module load mongodb-4.0` to load the MongoDB client.

--
This command can be automatically run every time you log into the **i6** web server... [details here](#bashrc).

--

- Next, use the MongoDB client to connect to the database server: `mongo fb1258 --host class-mongodb.cims.nyu.edu -u fb1258 -p`, where `fb1258` is replaced by your own NYU Net ID.

--

- You will be asked to supply your MongoDB server account password... do so.

---

template: setup

## Verify that you are truly logged in

Prove to yourself that you are logged into a Javascript command-line interface to MongoDB.

--

- Type `1 + 1` and hit Enter.

--

- Did it respond with `2`?

--
If so, you're ready to start using your MongoDB database.

---

template: setup
name: bashrc

## .bashrc files

Every time you log into the **i6** web server, you must run the `module load mongodb-4.0` to [load the MongoDB client](#connect-to-mongo) before using it.

--

- It is possible to automatically run this command every time you log in.

--

- You can do this by adding this command to your **i6** account's `.bashrc` settings file.

--

- From the **i6** command line, run the command `emacs .bashrc` to open up this file in the [emacs](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=emacs+shortcuts&t=brave&ia=cheatsheet&iax=1) text editor.

--

- Add `module load mongodb-4.0` as a line in this file.

--

- Save this file by typing `Control-X` and then `Control-S`.

--

- Exit emacs by typing `Control-X` and then `Control-C`.

--

- Now this command will run automatically every time you log in.
